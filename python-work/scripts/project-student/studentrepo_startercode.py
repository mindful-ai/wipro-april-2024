# Read the csv file as a text file



# ------------------------ csv file is read and its content is available for further processing

# Read the coloums --> name,age,regid,phy,chem,math,bio,avg,rank
# Read a row --> Vijay,14,HPE001,99,98,97,96,0,0
# Construct a dictionary out of the column and the row
# Add that dictionary to the main dictionry that represents the class
# Repeat this process for all the entries in the csv file



# ------------------------- csv data is in the form of a dictionary

# Access the dictionary iteratively and calculate the average marks and
# update in the dictionary




# ------------------------- dictionary updated with average data

# Calculate the rank
# collect all the averages -> into a list
# arrange the averages in descending order
# iterate the entire dictionary and update the rank based on the descending
# order of averages



# ------------------------- dictionary updated with rank data

# Re-write the csv file
